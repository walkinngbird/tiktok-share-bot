THIS IS A WARNING FOR ANYONE USING THIS BOT!
If you try to run the .exe with windows virus protection enabled, the file will not start and it will be deleted from your computer.
If you would like to take the risk and continue on, you must temporaily disbale windows virus protection. These are the steps to do so.
1) Open up your windows settings
2) Go to "Privacy and Security" then "Windows Security"
3) Then click on "Virus and Threat Protection"
4) This should open a new window
5) In this window, you should see a subheading "Virus and Threat Protection Settings", click on the button manage settings underneath it
6) There should be a massive first option called "Real-time Protection", you'll want to turn this off. Don't worry, Windows will automatically turn this back on so you
won't have to worry about malware getting on your pc.
7) Open the Tiktok.exe file
8) You should get another window where Windows is warning you that they are unsure if this file is safe. This shows up since I am unable to pay $500 to Microsoft for a
certificate for the file.
9) You should see a button called something "More info"
10) After clicking this, you should see "Run anyway" or "Run" at the bottom of the window.
